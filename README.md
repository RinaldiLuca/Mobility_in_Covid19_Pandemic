## Abstract
The project is intended to study the correlation between the human mobility and the evolution of the epidemic, 
trying to divide the data in time windows in order to make them as homogeneous as possible.

In the second part we aim to study the real effectiveness of the restrictions on the human mobility, and eventually infer the time after which the the restriction became effective.
